Welcome to Zihao's Rendering Engine

Please set your solution platform to x86 to make the program successfully build.

I'm using Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 as my developing environment. There might be a little problem if you 
are using a different version of VS. Figure that out on your own.

If you have any questions or suggestions, please email me at wangzihao0521@hotmail.com. Thank you.

PS: For the first a few commits, set Visual Studio default command arguments to teapot.obj to draw a teapot in the scene.
